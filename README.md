## Task 1

Reimplement the `bouncingballs.py` to utilize as much object oriented concept as possible. Use file `HMW2_task1.py` to write your code.

1. Make sure that all data is in objects;
2. Make sure that "data encapsulation" is never broken;
3. Make sure that public interface of classes are as small as possible.  

(Hint: implement a `Game` class to handle game related functions. You can add more classes if you think its needed.)

## Task 2

Make necessary modifications so that the game pauses when a lower treshold is exceeded as the user slows the game down. Use file `HMW2_task2.py` to write your code.
